PayLib is your easy python payments API for PayPal and, in future, Google Wallet.

It is based on the great work of Luca Sepe’s PyPal-NVP http://code.google.com/p/pypal-nvp/ which is itself based on a java implementation over at http://sourceforge.net/projects/paypal-nvp/.

PayLib is updated to reflect more recent changes in the PayPal Name Value Pair (NVP) API and extended to offer a more complete coverage of the Express Checkout API methods. I’m also partially using it to become a better Python programmer hopefully by evolving it’s codebase into a more pythonic implementation over time.

For now you can set up & manage digital subscriptions using PayLib quickly and cleanly, giving you an easy way of earning regular payments for your web app. The first site to take advantage of PayLib is One Click Analytics.
